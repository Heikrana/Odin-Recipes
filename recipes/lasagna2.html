		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Lasagne originated in Italy during the Middle Ages and have
			traditionally been ascribed to the city of Naples. The first recorded
			recipe was set down in the early 14th-century Liber de Coquina (The
			Book of Cookery). It bore only a slight resemblance to the later
			traditional form of lasagne, featuring a fermented dough flattened into
			thin sheets (lasagne), boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, and
			then eaten with a small pointed stick. Recipes written in the century
			following the Liber de Coquina recommended boiling the pasta in chicken
			broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. In a recipe adapted
			for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended. The traditional lasagne
			of Naples, lasagne di carnevale, are layered with local sausage, small
			fried meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and
			sauced with a Neapolitan ragù, a meat sauce. Lasagne al forno, layered
			with a thicker ragù and Béchamel sauce, and corresponding to the most
			common version of the dish outside Italy, are traditionally associated
			with the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. In other regions, lasagne can
			be made with various combinations of ricotta or mozzarella cheese,
			tomato sauce, meats (e.g., ground beef, pork or chicken), and
			vegetables (e.g., spinach, zucchini, olives, mushrooms), and the dish
			is typically flavoured with wine, garlic, onion, and oregano. In all
			cases, the lasagne are oven-baked (al forno).
